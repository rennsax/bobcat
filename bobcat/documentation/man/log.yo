manpagedescription()

The class bf(FBB::Log) defines an tt(std::ostream) using an tt(FBB::LogBuf
std::streambuf). It is used to send log-messages to the (r)syslog stream or to
a (configurable) file. Refer to the bf(logbuf)(3bobcat) man-page for
details about tt(LogBuf).

Which (part of) messages are actually logged can be configured using
bf(FBB::level) in combination with the tt(Log) member tt(setLevel). By default
all information that is inserted into a tt(Log) object is logged, but
tt(level) objects (bf(level)(3bobcat)) can be inserted specifying insertion
`forces' of the information that is subsequently inserted into tt(Log)
objects. These `forces' are compared to insertion `resistances' that may be
specified by tt(Log) objects through their tt(setLevel) members.

If the tt(level's) `force' is equal to or exceeds the tt(Log)
object's `resistance' then the insertion is performed, otherwise the insertion
is ignored. A single insertion statement may contain multiple tt(level)
calls. If so, then each tt(level) call updates the `force' of insertions
following the tt(level) call. 

Information inserted into tt(Log) objects without inserting tt(level) objects
(or before the first tt(level) object) is always logged (see also the
bf(Examples) section).

    tt(std::ostream)

manpagesection(ENUMERATIONS)

    The enumeration tt(TimeStamps) is defined in the namespace tt(FBB),
primarily for initializing tt(FBB::LogBuf) objects. It is used with
tt(Log) members as well. It has the following values:
    itemization(
    itb(NOTIMESTAMPS)
        Log-messages will not have timestamps prepended to them.
    itb(TIMESTAMPS)
        Log-messages will have timestamps prepended to them.
    itb(UTCTIMESTAMPS)
        Log-messages will have timestamps showing the UTC time prepended to
        them.
    )

    The enumeration tt(LogManipulator) is used to handle special or
exceptional situations through manipulators. It is defined in the namespace
tt(FBB) and has the following two values:
    itemization(
    itb(FATAL)
        When inserting tt(FATAL) into a tt(Log) object an
tt(FBB::Exception) exception is thrown (see tt(operator<<) below);

    itb(nl)
        When inserting tt(nl) into a tt(Log) object a tt(\n) character is
inserted into the current line. If time stamps are requested the the next line
will not begin with a time stamp. It is used to allow a single log message to
occupy multiple textual lines. The next logged line is not indented over the
width of the omitted time stamp. If that's preferred: the time stamp occupies
15 character positions (not counting the width of the delimiter, see the
bf(CONSTRUCTORS) section below). If a tt(level) specification is active, it
remains active at insertions following tt(nl).

    itb(fnl)
        When inserting tt(fnl) (forced new line) into a tt(Log) object the
current line ends even if the currently active insertion `force' (set by
tt(level)) is lower than the tt(Log) object's `resistance' level. If a tt(level)
specification is active, it remains active at insertions following tt(fnl).

    it() bf(endl) or bf(\n):nl()
        When inserting tt(endl) or tt(\n) the current line is ended and the
next logged line starts with a timestamp (unless timestamps are
suppressed). The tt(endl) manipulator is the standard tt(ostream) manipulator:
when inserted into a tt(Log) object its buffer is flushed. The scope of a
tt(level) specification ends at tt(\n) or tt(endl). E.g.,
        verb(
log.setLevel(2);
log << level(1) << "first line\n"
       "second line\n";
    )
    results in tt(second line) (preceded by a timestamp) being logged.
    )

manpagesection(CONSTRUCTORS)
    itemization(
    itb(Log())
        The default constructor creates a tt(Log) object which isn't yet
associated with a stream to log messages on. The member tt(open) (see below)
may be used to define such a stream.  By default, all messages are preceded by
a time stamp (see the description of the member tt(setTimestamp) below), and a
single space character is inserted as delimiter immediately beyond the time
stamp. The member tt(open) can be used to modify the default delimiter.

    itb(Log(std::ostream &out, char const *delim = " "))
        This constructor creates a tt(Log) object logging its messages to the
provided tt(std::ostream) object. By default, all messages are preceded by a
time stamp (see the description of the member tt(setTimestamp) below).  The
parameter tt(delim) is inserted immediately beyond the time stamp. If 
a delimiter should not be used an empty string or a 0-pointer may be
specified.

    itb(FBB::Log(std::string const &filename,
            std::ios::openmode mode = std::ios::out | std::ios::app, 
            char const *delim = " "))
        This constructor creates a tt(Log) object logging its messages to the
named file. If tt(filename == "&1") logmessages are written to the standard
output stream. If tt(filename == "&2") logmessages are written to the standard
error stream.  By default the file is created if not existing, and all
messages are appended to the stream. Also by default all messages are preceded
by time stamps (see the description of the member tt(setTimestamp) below).
The parameter tt(delim) is inserted immediately beyond the time stamp.  If a
delimiter should not be used an empty string or a 0-pointer may be specified.
    )

    Copy and move constructors (and assignment operators) are not available.

manpagesection(MEMBER FUNCTIONS)
     All members of tt(std::ostream) are available, as tt(Log) inherits
from this class.
    itemization(
    itb(size_t level())
        This member returns the currently set log level (i.e., the value set
at the latest tt(setLevel()) call). By default, the level is set to zero,
meaning that all information is inserted into the log stream.

    itb(std::ostream &level(size_t useLevel))
        This member defines a log-level. Messages will be inserted into
the stream when tt(useLevel) is equal to or exceeds the level set by
    tt(setLevel). The maximum level which can be selected is
tt(std::numeric_limits<size_t>::max()). If not even such messages should be
inserted into the tt(ostream), then the stream should be deactivated, using
tt(off()), see below. The selected level remains active until
redefined. Alternatively, the tt(FBB::level) manipulator may be inserted into
an (empty) tt(Log) object (see bf(level)(3bobcat)).

    itb(void off())
        Prevents log messages from being generated. It may be cancelled using
tt(setLevel) (see below).

    itb(void open(std::string const &filename,
            std::ios::openmode mode = std::ios::out | std::ios::app, 
            char const *delim = " "))
        This member (re)associates a tt(Log) object with the named file. If
tt(filename == "&1") the logmessages will be written to the standard output
stream. If tt(filename == "&2") the logmessages will be written to the
standard error stream.  By default the file is created if not existing, and
all messages are appended to the stream. Also by default all messages are
preceded by time stamps (see the description of the member tt(setTimestamp)
below).  The parameter tt(delim) is inserted immediately beyond the time
stamp.  If a delimiter should not be used an empty string or a 0-pointer may
be specified.

    itb(void setLevel(size_t resistance))
        Redefines the `resistance' against message insertions. Insertions are
performed if their `force' are equal to or exceed the tt(Log) object's
`resistance'. The `force' of insertions is specified using tt(FBB::level). If
tt(setLevel) is called without an explicit argument, logging is suspended
(comparable to using the member tt(off)).

    itb(void setTimestamp(FBB::TimeStamps stamp, char const *delim = " "))
        The member function (de)activates time stamp prepending. Use the value
tt(FBB::TIMESTAMPS) to prepend time stamps, tt(FBB::NOTIMESTAMPS) suppresses
time stamps.  A timestamp consists of 15 characters showing the abbreviated
month's name, two-digits specifying the day number of the month, and the
(local or UTC) time of the current message, as usually appearing in messages
in tt(/var/log) files. E.g., tt(Aug 05 13:52:23). The parameter tt(delim) is
inserted immediately beyond the time stamp. If a delimiter is inappropriate,
an empty string or a 0-pointer may be specified. When specifying tt(stamps ==
FBB::NOTIMESTAMPS delim) also is ignored.
    )

manpagesection(STATIC MEMBERS)
    itemization(
    itb(FBB::Log &initialize(std::string const &filename,
            std::ios::openmode mode = std::ios::out | std::ios::app, 
            char const *delim = " "))
        
        Returns a reference to a static tt(Log) object. It may only be
called once, or an tt(FBB::Exception) exception is thrown. It associates a
static tt(Log) object with the named file. 

If tt(filename == "&1") logmessages are written to the standard
output stream. If tt(filename == "&2") logmessages are written to the standard
error stream.  By default the file is created if not existing, and all
messages are appended to the stream. Also by default all messages are preceded
by time stamps (see the description of the member tt(setTimestamp) below).
The parameter tt(delim) is inserted immediately beyond the time stamp.  If a
delimiter should not be used an empty string or a 0-pointer may be specified.

    itb(FBB::Log &instance())
        Returns a reference to a static tt(Log) object, available after
calling tt(Log::initialize). If called before tt(Log::initialize())
an tt(FBB::Exception) exception is thrown. 
    )

manpagesection(OVERLOADED OPERATOR)
    The following overloaded operator is defined outside of the tt(FBB)
namespace. It is used to insert an tt(FBB::LogManipulator) into a
tt(Log) object. If the overloaded operator is used in combination with
another kind of stream it performs no actions.
    itemization(
    itb(std::ostream &::operator<<(std::ostream &str, FBB::LogManipulator)) 
        When inserting tt(FBB::FATAL) an tt(FBB::Exception) exception is
thrown; when inserting tt(FBB::nl) the line is terminated, but next insertions
will not start with a time stamp (if applicable).
    )

manpagebugs()
    The tt(nl) and tt(fnl) manipulators are received by the tt(Log) objects'
tt(LogBufs) as, respectively, characters 0 and 1. Since log files in
practice only received printable characters this should not cause any
problems.
