manpagedescription()
    The class tt(CryptBuf) inherits from tt(EoiBuf) and may therefore be
used as a base class of classes specializing tt(std::streambuf). It is used as
base class for the classes tt(DecryptBuf) and tt(EncryptBuf), offering a
protected member for accessing cipher information.

includefile(include/namespace)

manpagesection(INHERITS FROM)
    tt(EoiBuf) (and thus from: tt(std::streambuf))

manpagesection(PROTECTED CONSTRUCTOR)

    Analogously to tt(std::streambuf) only a protected constructor is
        available.

    itemization(
    itb(CryptBuf(char const *type, size_t bufSize))
       The type is a null-terminated byte string specifying the de/encryption
        method. E.g., tt(aes-128-cbc). For an overview see the
        bf(encryptbuf)(3bobcat) man-page. The tt(bufSize) parameter defines
        the initial size of the internally used buffer (defined by
        tt(EoiBuf)). 
    )

    Copy and move constructors (and assignment operators) are not available.


manpagesection(PROTECTED MEMBER FUNCTION) 

   All members of tt(std:streambuf) and tt(EoiBuf) are available, as
    bf(FBB::CryptBuf) inherits from these classes.

    itemization(
    itb(EVP_CIPHER const *md() const)
       A pointer to the cipher information is returned.
    )

manpagesection(EXAMPLE)
    Here is an example from the implementation of tt(EncryptBuf's)
        constructor:

    verbinclude(../../encryptbuf/encryptbuf1.cc)

manpagefiles()
    em(bobcat/cryptbuf) - defines the class interface

manpageseealso()
    bf(bobcat)(7), bf(decryptbuf)(3bobcat), bf(encryptbuf)(3bobcat),
        bf(eoibuf)(3bobcat), bf(eoi)(3bobcat)

manpagebugs()
    None Reported.
