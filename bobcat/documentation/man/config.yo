manpagedescription()
    bf(Config) objects process standard tt(unix)-style configuration
files.  Initial white-space (blanks and tabs) are removed from processed
lines.  If a line ends in a backslash (\), then the backslash is removed and
the next line (initial white-space removed) is appended to the current line.

    If the tt(rmComment) flag is set to tt(true) blanks lines and information
on lines from the first tt(#) are removed. If a backslash precedes the comment
character (i.e., tt(\#)) then this is not considered comment, but it is
replaced by a single tt(#) character. Similarly, if the tt(rmComment) flag was
set two consecutive backslash characters are replaced by a single backslash
character.

All lines of the configuration file (possibly without comment) are stored in
the bf(Config) object. Their line numbers can also be retrieved. 

At construction time comment handling (keep comment / remove comment) and type
of searching (case sensitive / insensitive) can be specified. 

In addition to one of the constructors, the tt(open) member can be used to
processes a configuration file, replacing the object's current content by the
content of another configuration file. The tt(open) member cannot be used to
alter the configuration file's processing parameters, but overloaded
assignment is supported and comment- and letter-case handling can be modified
by set-members.

Often lines in configuration show the following structure:
        verb(
    id: value   trailing content
        )
    If tt(id) is a bf(C++) identifier it is called an tt(ID) in this
man-page. When looking for tt(IDs) all non white-space characters immediately
following the tt(ID) are ignored. A tt(Key) is defined as the first
white-space delimited entry  on lines. In the example the key is tt(id:).
The first space-delimited entry following the key is called the line's
em(value), whereas all of the line's content starting at tt(value) is called
the line's tt(tail). 

tt(Config) objects offer various members to process configuration file
lines that are structured this way. However, lines do not have to be
structured this way. All the lines of a configuration file are made available
by tt(Config) objects and can be processed in several other ways as well.

manpagesection(ENUMERATIONS)
    The following enumerations are defined by the class bf(Config):
    itemization(
    itb(Comment)
        This enumeration has two values: nl()
        bf(Config::KeepComment) specifies that comment on lines must be
            kept; nl()
        bf(Config::NoComment) specifies that comment on lines must be
            removed;

    itb(Casing)
        This enumeration also has two values:nl() 
        bf(Config::UseCase) specifies that specified targets must match
            case-sensitively;nl()
        bf(Config::NoCase) specifies that specified targets are matched
            case-insensitively;nl()
    )

manpagesection(TYPES)
    The following types are defined by the class tt(Config):
    itemization(
    itb(const_iterator)
       a random access iterator referring to a line read from a configuration
        file. tt(FBB::Config::const_iterator) objects point to
        tt(FBB::CF_Line) objects (see the next section for a description of
        the class tt(CF_Line));

    itb(CIVect::const_iterator)
       an iterator type referring to lines matching regular expressions or
        IDs. It supports the standard random access iterator facilities. The
        dereference operators of tt(FBB::Config::CIVect::const_iterator)
        objects return tt(FBB::Config::const_iterator) objects;
    )

    When two tt(CIVect::const_iterator) objects are subtracted the number of
lines matching their regular expressions (or IDs) is returned. E.g.,
        verb(
    Config cf(...)
    auto pair = cf.beginEndID("scenario");
    cout << "There are " << (pair.second - pair.first) << 
            " lines starting with the ID `scenario'\n";
        )

    bf(Pattern)(3bobcat) objects are used when looking for lines matching
regular expressions.
    
manpagesection(CF_Line)

    tt(const_iterators) point to objects of the class
tt(FBB::CF_Line). Objects of this class contain a line from the configuration
file and its line number. The class offers the following facilities:
    itemization(
    itb(CF_Line())
       the default constructor initialized its object with line number 0,
        and an empty line;
    itb(CF_Line(uint16_t lineNr, std::string const &line))
       this constructor initialized its object with line number tt(lineNr),
        and a copy of the contents of tt(line);
    itb(std::string const &line() const)
       returns the object's line;
    itb(std::string key() const)
       returns the line's em(key) field;
    itb(uint16_t lineNr() const)
       returns the line's line number;
    itb(std::string tail() const)
       returns the line's em(tail) field;
    itb(std::string value() const)
       returns the line's em(value) field;
    )
    tt(CF_Line) objects may be inserted into tt(std::ostream) objects,
inserting their lines into the streams.

    Copy- and move-constructors and -assignment operators are available.

manpagesection(CONSTRUCTORS)
    itemization(
    itb(Config(Casing sType = UseCase, Comment cType = NoComment))
       creates an empty object. It is not associated with a configuration
        file; the tt(open) member can be used for that. The parameters
        specify specific handling of comment, and letter-casing;

    itb(Config(std::string const &fname, Casing sType = UseCase, 
               Comment cType = NoComment)) 
       creates a bf(Config) object, containing the information from the
        configuration file tt(fname). The other parameters are used as
        described with the abovementioned constructor. If the file cannot be
        opened an tt(FBB::Exception) exception is thrown.

    itb(Config(std::istream &stream, Casing sType = UseCase, 
               Comment cType = NoComment)) 
       same functionality as the previous constructor, but reading the
        configuration information from the tt(std::istream stream).

    itb(Config(std::istream &&tmp, Casing sType = UseCase, 
               Comment cType = NoComment)) 
       same functionality as the previous constructor, but reading the
        configuration information from the tt(std::istream) rvalue reference
        tt(tmp).
    )

    Copy- and move-constructors and -assignment operators are available.

manpagesection(OVERLOADED OPERATORS)
    itemization(
    itb(CF_Line const &operator[](size_t idx) const)
       returns the (0-based) tt(idx)-th line of the configuration file.
    )

manpagesection(MEMBER FUNCTIONS)
    itemization(
    itb(const_iterator begin() const)
       returns a tt(const_iterator) referring to the first line of the
        configuration file;

    itb(std::pair<CIVect::const_iterator, CIVect::const_iterator>
         beginEndID(std::string const &rid) const)
       returns a pair of tt(CIVect::const_iterators). Its tt(first) field is
        an tt(CIVect::const_iterator) referring to the first line containing
        ID tt(id); its tt(second) field is a tt(CIVect::const_iterator)
        marking the end of the series of lines containing ID tt(id).

        The difference between the two iterators equals the number of lines
        containing ID tt(id);

    itb(std::pair<CIVect::const_iterator, CIVect::const_iterator>
         beginEndRE(std::string const &regex) const)
       same functionality as the previous member, but returning a pair of
        iterators to lines matching tt(regex);

    itb(const_iterator end() const)
       returns a tt(const_iterator) pointing beyond the last line of the
        configuration file;

    itb(const_iterator find(std::string const &target) const) 
       returns an iterator to the first line containing tt(target), starting
        the search at tt(begin()). Note that tt(target) may appear anywhere
        within a line. 
       It returns tt(end()) if no such line was found;

    itb(const_iterator find(std::string const &target, const_iterator from) 
        const) 
       same functionality as the previous member, but searching starts at
        tt(from);

    itb(const_iterator findID(std::string const &id) const) 
        returns an iterator of the the first line containing ID tt(id).
       It returns tt(end()) if no such line was found;

    itb(const_iterator findID(std::string const &id, const_iterator from) 
       const) 
       same functionality as the previous member, but searching starts at
        tt(from);

    itb(const_iterator findKey(std::string const &key) const) 
       returns an iterator of the the first line containing key `tt(key)'.
       It returns tt(end()) if no such line was found;

    itb(const_iterator findKey(std::string const &key, const_iterator from) 
       const) 
       same functionality as the previous member, but searching starts at
        tt(from);

    itb(const_iterator findRE(std::string const &regex) const)
       returns an iterator is returned to the first line matching the regular
        expression tt(regex).
       It returns tt(end()) if no such line was found;

    itb(void open(std::string const &fname))
       the content of the file named tt(fname) is stored in the tt(Config)
        object, replacing any previously stored content. The file is read
        according to the latest setting of the tt(Comment) and tt(Casing)
        flags. If the file cannot be opened an tt(FBB::Exception) exception is
        thrown;

    itb(void open(std::istream &&tmp))
       same functionality as the previous member, but reading the
        configuration information from the tt(std::istream) rvalue reference
        tt(tmp).

    itb(void setComment(Comment type))
       the object's comment-handling type is set to tt('type') (ether
        tt(KeepComment) or tt(NoComment)). It doesn't affect the current
        content of the bf(Config) object, but when calling tt(open) the
        configuration file is processed according to tt(type's) value;

    itb(void setCasing(Casing type))
       the object's letter case handling type is set to tt('type') (either
        tt(UseCase) or tt(NoCase));

    itb(size_t size() const)
       returns the number of lines stored in the tt(Config) object;
    )

manpagesection(EXAMPLE)
    Assume the configuration file is named tt(config.rc), containing the
    following lines:

    COMMENT(Keep the blank following the backslashes below:)
    verb(

# this is ignored

noline: this one too

line: this is found

this is not a line containing line: at the beginning \ 
                                    of the line

line: this one is

    line: what about this one? \ 
        it extends over multiple lines

and there may, of course, be more lines in this file
    )

    The next program may be compiled and run as tt(a.out config.rc):
    verb(
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
#include <bobcat/config>

using namespace std;
using namespace FBB;
    
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    Config cf(argv[1]);     

    cout << *cf.find("this one") << '\n'; // find text within a line

                                     // find all lines specifying ID 'line'
    auto [begin, end] = cv.beginEndID("line");
    copy(begin, end, ostream_iterator<CF_Line>(cout, "\n"));
}
    )

    Producing the output:
    verb(
line: this is found
line: this one is
line: what about this one? it extends over multiple lines
    )
