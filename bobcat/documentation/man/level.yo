manpagedescription()
    An bf(FBB::level) object is used to specify insertion `forces' of
information that is inserted into bf(FBB::Log) objects. When inserted into
tt(Log) objects it defines the `force' of subsequent insertions (or tt(write)
calls) into those tt(Log) objects. 

Conversely, tt(Log) objects may specify insertion `resistances' through their
tt(setLevel) members. If the tt(level's) `force' is equal to or exceeds the
tt(Log) object's `resistance' then the insertion is performed, otherwise the
insertion is ignored. A single insertion statement may contain multiple
tt(level) calls. If so, then each tt(level) call updates the `force' of
insertions following the tt(level) call.

By default insertions into tt(Log) objects not preceded by tt(level)
insertions are completed.

When a tt(level) object is inserted into another kind of tt(std::ostream)
object the tt(level) object performs no actions.

manpagesection(CONSTRUCTORS)
    itemization(
    itb(level(size_t force))
        This constructor is used in insertion statements, usually inserting it
as anonymous object into an tt(FBB::Log) object. 
    )

    Copy and move constructors (and assignment operators) are available.

manpagesection(OVERLOADED OPERATOR)
    itemization(
    itb(std::ostream &::operator<<(std::ostream &ostr, 
            FBB::level const &force))  
        If the tt(ostr) can be downcasted to an tt(FBB::Log) object then
subsequent insertions are performed if tt(force) exceeds the tt(Log) object's
`resistance' as specified by its tt(setLevel) member.  If tt(ostr) does not
actually refer to a tt(Log) object then tt(ostr) is returned without any
further action, and tt(ostr) handles subsequent insertions in its default way.
